<span><p>For decades young and old have played in garage bands, rap groups, pop acts and more. Very few of these artists went on to be the next Nirvana, Run-DMC, or Elton John, but that didn't mean they weren't good.

Many recorded their creations but for whatever reason moved on in life or developed other interests and the songs were retired. I’m searching for the songs that were left behind, trapped on old cassette tapes, compact discs and various other types of audio storage, I would like feature them on this podcast and hear the stories that shaped them.

If you are happy to share your music and story, record a commentary or be featured on the show please reach out*, I  would love to hear your story and hear a song you created before you cut your hair and got a proper job. Let us free some of these abandoned songs, demos and experiments from around the world and hear the stories behind these works that have remained hidden for so long.
